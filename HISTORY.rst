Release History
---------------

0.8.4 (2018-10-29)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Notebook metadata is filtered - only the most common metadata are stored in the text representation (#105)
- New config option ``freeze_metadata`` on the content manager and on the command line interface (defaults to ``False``). Use this option to avoid creating a YAML header or cell metadata if there was none initially. (#110)
- Language magic arguments are preserved in R Markdown, and also supported in ``light`` and ``percent`` scripts (#111, #114, #115)
- First markdown cell exported as a docstring when using the Sphinx format (#107)

0.8.3 (2018-10-19)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Frozen cells are supported in R Markdown, light and percent scripts (#101)
- Inactive cells extended to percent scripts (#108)
- ``jupytext`` gains a ``--version`` argument (#103)
- "ExecuteTime" cell metadata is not included in the text representation anymore (#106)


0.8.2 (2018-10-15)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Round trip conversion testing with ``jupytext --test`` was improved (#99)
- Round trip conversion tested on Jake Vanderplas' Python for Data Science Handbook.

**BugFixes**

- Nested lists and dictionaries are now supported in notebook metadata
- Final empty code cell supported in Sphinx representation

0.8.1 (2018-10-11)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**BugFixes**

- Sphinx format tested on ``World population`` notebook (#97)
- Mirror test made stronger on this occasion!
- Markdown representation recognize Julia, Scheme and C++ code cells as such
- Light representation of Scheme and C++ notebooks fixed (#61)

0.8.0 (2018-10-10)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- All ``jupytext`` related metadata goes to a ``jupytext`` section (#91). Please make sure your collaborators use the same version of Jupytext, as the new version can read previous metadata, but not the opposite.
- Notebooks extensions can be prefixed with any prefix of at most three chars (#87).
- Export of the same notebook to multiple formats is now supported. To export to all python formats, plus ``.ipynb`` and ``.md``, use ``"jupytext": {"formats": "ipynb,pct.py:percent,lgt.py:light,spx.py:sphinx,md"},``.
- README includes a short section on how to extend ``light`` and ``percent`` formats to more languages (#61).
- Jupytext's contents manager accepts the ``auto`` extension in ``default_jupytext_formats`` (#93).
- All Jupyter magics are escaped in ``light`` scripts and R markdown documents. Escape magics in other formats with a ``comment_magics`` metadata (true or false), or with the contents manager ``comment_magics`` global flag (#94).

**BugFixes**

- Trusting notebooks made functional again.
- Command line ``jupytext`` returns a meaningful error when no argument is given.
- Fixed global pairing configuration (#95).

0.7.2 (2018-10-01)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- ``light`` and ``percent`` formats made available for scheme and cpp notebooks. Adding more formats is straightforward - just add a new entry to _SCRIPT_EXTENSIONS in languages.py, a sample notebook and a mirror test (#61)
- Format name is automatically appended to extension in ``jupytext_formats`` when notebook is loaded/saved.

**BugFixes**

- Notebooks extensions can only be prefixed with ``.nb`` (#87)


0.7.1 (2018-09-24)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**BugFixes**

- Markdown cells header in sphinx gallery format may have a space between first # and following.

0.7.0 (2018-09-23)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Header for cells in ``percent`` format is more robust: use ``[markdown]`` and ``[raw]`` to identify cell types. Cell type comes after the cell title. (#59)

0.7.0-rc0 (2018-09-22)
++++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Jupytext can read and write notebooks as Hydrogen/VScode/Spyder/PyCharm compatible scripts (cells starting with ``# %%``) (#59)
- Jupytext can read and write notebooks as Sphinx-gallery compatible scripts (#80)
- Metadata are supported for all cell types in light python and percent formats (#66). Due to this, light python format version is now 1.3. Light python notebooks in versions 1.1 and 1.2 are still readable.
- Command line ``jupytext`` has a ``from`` argument, and now accepts notebook from the standard input.

**BugFixes**

- Fix merging of input and output notebooks (#83)
- Removed extra new line on stdout in command line ``jupytext`` (#84)

0.6.3 (2018-09-07)

0.6.1 (2018-08-31)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Package and conversion script renamed from ``nbrmd`` to ``jupytext``.

0.6.0 (2018-08-31)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Cell parsing and exporting done in two specialized classes. This is way easier to read. Pylint score at 9.9 !
- Python file format updated to 1.1: default end of cell for python scripts is one blank space. Two blank spaces are allowed as well. Now you can reformat code in Python IDE without breaking notebook cells (#38).
- Added support for plain markdown files (#40, #44).
- Demonstration notebooks more user friendly (#45).
- Command line tool simpler to use (#46).
- Start code patterns present in Jupyter cells are escaped.
- Default ``nbrmd_format`` is empty (mwouts/nbsrc/#5): no Jupyter notebook is created on disk when the user opens a Python or R file and saves it from Jupyter, unless the users asks for it by setting ``nbrmd_format``.

**BugFixes**

- Fixed message in the ``nbsrc`` script (#43)
- Technical metadata don't appear any more in scripts unless required (#42)
- Code cells that are fully commented remain code cells after round trip (#41)

- Explicit file format version, set at 1.0, to avoid overriding ipynb files by accident (#36)


0.5.1 (2018-08-21)

0.5.0 (2018-08-21)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Jupyter magic commands escaped when exported (#29)
- 'endofcell' option for explicit (optional) end-of-cell marker (#31)
- 'active' cell option now supported for .py and .R export (#30)

- Extensions can be prefixed, like ``.nb.py``, (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- When a file with an extension not associated to 'ipynb' is opened and saved, no 'ipynb' file is created (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- Extensions can now be a sequence of groups. For instance, ``nbrmd_formats="ipynb,nb.py;script.ipynb,py"`` will create an ``ipynb`` file when a ``nb.py`` is opened (and conversely), and a ``script.ipynb`` file when a ``py`` file is opened (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- ``nbsrc`` script was moved to the ``nbrmd`` package. The ``nbsrc`` package now only contains the documentation (mwouts/nbsrc#3)
