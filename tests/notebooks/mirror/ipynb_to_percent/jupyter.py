# %% [markdown]
# # Jupyter notebook
#
# This notebook is a simple jupyter notebook. It only has markdown and code cells. And it does not contain consecutive markdown cells. We start with an addition:

# %%
a = 1
b = 2
a + b

# %% [markdown]
# Now we return a few tuples

# %%
a, b

# %%
a, b, a+b

# %% [markdown]
# And this is already the end of the notebook
