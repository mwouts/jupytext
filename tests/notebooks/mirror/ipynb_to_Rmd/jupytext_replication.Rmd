## What is SOS kernel

SoS consists of a ployglot notebook that allows the use of multiple kernels in one Jupyter notebook, and a workflow system that is designed for daily computational research. Basically,

- SoS Polyglot Notebook is a Jupyter Notebook with a SoS kernel.
- SoS Notebook serves as a super kernel to all other Jupyter kernels and allows the use of multiple kernels in one Jupyter notebook.
- SoS Workflow System is a Python based workflow system that is designed to be readable, shareable, and suitable for daily data analysis.
- SoS Workflow System can be used from command line or use SoS Notebook as its IDE.

### How to install SOS-kernel

Please follow this [link](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/running.html#Conda-installation) to setup SOS

I run some issue with the latest version of R on my Mac, so I had to install an earlier version of R

```
conda install -c r r=3.5.1
conda install sos-notebook jupyterlab-sos sos-papermill -c conda-forge
```

## Related issue with Jupytext

Jupytext works fine with Python/R kernel but converts code cells into markdown cells when using the SOS kernel.

cf the image below. It is a code cell. After saving the notebook and restart it, it converted the code cell into markdown

## Step 1

Please, choose SOS Kernel and then, in the cell code, choose SOS (or any other kernel available), the outcome is the same.

```{sos Collapsed="false", kernel="SoS"}
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np

pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.random.random(10),
    'y': np.random.random(10),
})
```

## Step 2

Now, pair it with Jupytex

<!-- #region Collapsed="false" kernel="python3" -->
### Step 3

Save the notebook, restart and clear all, **save**, then Shut down kernel. Close the notebook and reopen

<!-- #region Collapsed="false" kernel="python3" -->
### Step 4

Reopen the notebook. Here is the outcome
