# Jupyter notebook

This notebook is a simple jupyter notebook. It only has markdown and code cells. And it does not contain consecutive markdown cells. We start with an addition:
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
a = 1
b = 2
a + b
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
Now we return a few tuples
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
a, b
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
a, b, a+b
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
And this is already the end of the notebook
