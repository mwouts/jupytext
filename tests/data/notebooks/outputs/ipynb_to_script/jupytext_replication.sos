# ## What is SOS kernel
#
# SoS consists of a ployglot notebook that allows the use of multiple kernels in one Jupyter notebook, and a workflow system that is designed for daily computational research. Basically,
#
# - SoS Polyglot Notebook is a Jupyter Notebook with a SoS kernel.
# - SoS Notebook serves as a super kernel to all other Jupyter kernels and allows the use of multiple kernels in one Jupyter notebook.
# - SoS Workflow System is a Python based workflow system that is designed to be readable, shareable, and suitable for daily data analysis.
# - SoS Workflow System can be used from command line or use SoS Notebook as its IDE.

# ### How to install SOS-kernel
#
# Please follow this [link](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/running.html#Conda-installation) to setup SOS
#
# I run some issue with the latest version of R on my Mac, so I had to install an earlier version of R
#
# ```
# conda install -c r r=3.5.1
# conda install sos-notebook jupyterlab-sos sos-papermill -c conda-forge
# ```
#
# ## Related issue with Jupytext
#
# Jupytext works fine with Python/R kernel but converts code cells into markdown cells when using the SOS kernel.
#
# cf the image below. It is a code cell. After saving the notebook and restart it, it converted the code cell into markdown

# ## Step 1
#
# Please, choose SOS Kernel and then, in the cell code, choose SOS (or any other kernel available), the outcome is the same.

# ### Step 3
#
# Save the notebook, restart and clear all, **save**, then Shut down kernel. Close the notebook and reopen
