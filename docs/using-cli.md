# Using Jupytext at the command line

## Command line conversion

The package provides a `jupytext` script for command line conversion between the various notebook extensions:

```bash
jupytext --to py notebook.ipynb                 # convert notebook.ipynb to a .py file
jupytext --to py:percent notebook.ipynb         # convert notebook.ipynb to a .py file in the double percent format
jupytext --to py:percent --comment-magics false notebook.ipynb   # same as above + do not comment magic commands
jupytext --to markdown notebook.ipynb           # convert notebook.ipynb to a .md file
jupytext --output script.py notebook.ipynb      # convert notebook.ipynb to a script.py file

jupytext --to notebook notebook.py              # convert notebook.py to an .ipynb file with no outputs
jupytext --update --to notebook notebook.py     # update the input cells in the .ipynb file and preserve outputs and metadata

jupytext --to md --test notebook.ipynb          # Test round trip conversion

jupytext --to md --output - notebook.ipynb      # display the markdown version on screen
jupytext --from ipynb --to py:percent           # read ipynb from stdin and write double percent script on stdout
```

Jupytext has a `--sync` mode that updates all the paired representations of a notebook based on timestamps: 
```bash
jupytext --set-formats --ipynb,py notebook.ipynb  # Turn notebook.ipynb into a paired ipynb/py notebook
jupytext --sync notebook.ipynb                    # Update whichever of notebook.ipynb/notebook.py is outdated
```

For convenience, when creating a notebook from text you can execute it:
```bash
jupytext --set-kernel - notebook.md             # set a kernel metadata on the given notebook that points to the current python executable 
jupytext --to notebook --execute notebook.md    # convert notebook.md to an .ipynb file and run it 
```

If you wanted to convert a collection of Markdown files to paired notebooks, and execute them in the current Python environment, you could run:
```bash
jupytext --set-formats ipynb,md --execute --sync *.md 
```

You may also find useful to `--pipe` the text representation of a notebook into tools like `black`:
```bash
jupytext --sync --pipe black notebook.ipynb    # read most recent version of notebook, reformat with black, save
```


Execute `jupytext --help` to access the full documentation.

## Jupytext as a Git pre-commit hook

Jupytext is also available as a Git pre-commit hook. Use this if you want Jupytext to create and update the `.py` (or `.md`...) representation of the staged `.ipynb` notebooks. All you need is to create an executable `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file with the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# For every ipynb file in the git index, add a Python representation
jupytext --from ipynb --to py:light --pre-commit
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# For every ipynb file in the git index:
# - apply black and flake8
# - export the notebook to a Python script in folder 'python'
# - and add it to the git index
jupytext --from ipynb --pipe black --check flake8 --pre-commit
jupytext --from ipynb --to python//py:light --pre-commit
```

If you don't want notebooks to be committed (and only commit the representations), you can ask the pre-commit hook to unstage notebooks after conversion by adding the following line:
```bash
git reset HEAD **/*.ipynb
```
Note that these hooks do not update the `.ipynb` notebook when you pull. Make sure to either run `jupytext` in the other direction, or to use our paired notebook and our contents manager for Jupyter. Also, Jupytext does not offer a merge driver. If a conflict occurs, solve it on the text representation and then update or recreate the `.ipynb` notebook. Or give a try to nbdime and its [merge driver](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/vcs.html#merge-driver).

## Testing the round-trip conversion

Representing Jupyter notebooks as scripts requires a solid round trip conversion. You don't want your notebooks (nor your scripts) to be modified because you are converting them to the other form. Our test suite includes a few hundred tests to ensure that round trip conversion is safe.

You can easily test that the round trip conversion preserves your Jupyter notebooks and scripts. Run for instance:
```bash
# Test the ipynb -> py:percent -> ipynb round trip conversion
jupytext --test notebook.ipynb --to py:percent

# Test the ipynb -> (py:percent + ipynb) -> ipynb (Ã  la paired notebook) conversion
jupytext --test --update notebook.ipynb --to py:percent
```

Note that `jupytext --test` compares the resulting notebooks according to its expectations. If you wish to proceed to a strict comparison of the two notebooks, use `jupytext --test-strict`, and use the flag `-x` to report with more details on the first difference, if any.

Please note that
- Scripts opened with Jupyter have a default [metadata filter](using-server.html#metadata-filtering) that prevents additional notebook or cell
metadata to be added back to the script. Remove the filter if you want to store Jupytext's settings, or the kernel information, in the text file.
- Cell metadata are available in the `light` and `percent` formats, as well as in the Markdown and R Markdown formats. R scripts in `spin` format support cell metadata for code cells only. Sphinx Gallery scripts in `sphinx` format do not support cell metadata.
- By default, a few cell metadata are not included in the text representation of the notebook. And only the most standard notebook metadata are exported. Learn more on this in the sections for [notebook specific](using-server.html#per-notebook-configuration) and [global settings](using-server.html#metadata-filtering) for metadata filtering.

## Reading notebooks in Python

Jupytext provides the same `read`, `write`, `reads` and `writes` functions as `nbformat`. You can use `jupytext`'s functions as drop-in replacements for `nbformat`'s ones. Jupytext's implementation provides an additional `fmt` argument, which can be any of `py`, `md`, `jl:percent`, etc. If not explicitly provided, the argument is inferred from the file extension.

```python
import jupytext

# Read a notebook from a file 
jupytext.read('notebook.md')

# Read a notebook from a string
jupytext.reads(text, fmt='md')

# Return the text representation of a notebook
jupytext.writes(notebook, fmt='py:percent')

# Write a notebook to a file in the desired format
jupytext.write(notebook, 'notebook.py')
jupytext.write(notebook, 'notebook.py', fmt='py:percent')
```
