"""R markdown notebook format for Jupyter

Use this module to read or write Jupyter notebooks as R Markdown documents
(methods 'read', 'reads', 'write', 'writes')

Use the jupyter pre-save hooks (see the documentation) to automatically
dump your Jupyter notebooks as a Rmd file, in addition to the ipynb file
(or the opposite)

Use the 'nbrmd' conversion script to convert Jupyter notebooks from/to
R Markdown notebooks.
