  # Let's not bother about bumping top level dependencies as they are mostly
  # developmental packages like linters. We can bump them manually
  # when we make changes to extension packages to be consistent with JupyterLab.
  # Importantly, these packages will not and should not effect the working of the
  # extension, so lets try to keep maintenance low by ignoring this.
