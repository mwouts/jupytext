**Added**

- Pairing a notebook to both `.md` and `.py` is now supported. Input cells are loaded from the most recent text representation (#290)
- Both the Jupyter Notebook and the Jupyter Lab extension for Jupytext were updated (#290)
- Raw cells are now encoded using HTML comments (`<!-- #raw -->` and `<!-- #endraw -->`) in Markdown files (#321)
- Markdown cells can be delimited with any of `<!-- #region -->`,  `<!-- #markdown -->` or `<!-- #md -->` (#344)
- Code blocks from Markdown files, when they don't have an explicit language, appear in Markdown cells in Jupyter (#321)
- Code blocks with an explicit language and a `.noeval` attribute are inactive in Jupyter (#347)
- Markdown and raw cells can be quoted with triple quotes in the `py:percent` format. And Markdown cells can start with just `# %% [md]` (#305)

- Explicit Markdown cells in the light format `# + [markdown]` can use triple quotes (#356)
- IPython magic help commands like `float?` are classified as magics, and thus commented in Python scripts (#297)
- Cell metadata can be encoded as either `key=value` (the new default) or in JSON. An automatic option `cell_metadata_json` should help minimize the impact on existing files (#344)
- R Markdown hidden inputs, outputs, or cells are now mapped to the corresponding Jupyter Book tags by default (#337)
- The notebook metadata filter is automatically updated when extra keys are added to the YAML header (#376)
- The Jupyter Notebook extension for Jupytext is compatible with Jupyter Notebook 6.0 (#346)

- `jupytext --check pytest notebook.ipynb` can be used to run test functions in a notebook (#286)
- `jupytext --check` and `jupytext --pipe` can run commands that only operate on files: when `{}` is found in the text of the command, `jupytext` saves the text representation of the notebook in a temp file, and replaces `{}` with the name of that file before executing the command. (#286)
- Documented how to sync notebooks in a pre-commit hook (#338)
- Added support for Rust/Evxcr, by Jonas Bushart (#351)
- Added support for [Robot Framework](https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/), by Asko Soukka (#378)
- Added support for PowerShell (#349)

**Changed**

- Use `CHANGELOG.md` rather than `HISTORY.rst`

**Fixed**

- Commands like `cat = x` are not magic commands, so they are not commented any more (#339)
- Fixed an inconsistent round trip (code cell with `"cat"` being converted to a markdown cell) in the `py:light` format (#339)
- `jupytext --test textfile.ext` now really compares the text file to its round trip (rather than the corresponding notebook) (#339)
- Markdown cells that contain code are now preserved in a round trip through the Markdown and R Markdown formats (#361)
- Code cells with a `%%python3` cell magic are now preserved in a round trip through the Markdown format (#365)
- `jupytext --execute` runs the notebook in its folder (#382)
- Strings in the metadata of code cells are quoted in the Rmd representation. And we escape R code in chunk options with `#R_CODE#` (#383)

------------------

**Added**

- The documentation includes a mention on how to set metadata filters at the command line (#330)

- The `read` and `write` functions are easier to use (#292)

**Fixed**

- Jupytext now ships the `jupyterlab-jupytext` extension in version 1.0.2. The version 1.0.1 erroneously introduces a `target_formats` metadata in the jupytext section, instead of `formats`, and works only after two clicks.

1.0.0 (2019-02-19)
------------------

**Added**

- Jupytext now includes a Jupyter Notebook extension and a JupyterLab extension (#86).
- Jupytext command line has more arguments: `--paired-paths` to list the paths for the paired representations of the notebook, and `--sync` to synchronise the content of all paired paths based on the most recent file (#146). In addition, the `--from` argument is optional even when the notebook is read from stdin (#148).
- The pairing information, and more generally the notebook metadata can be edited with the CLL, see the `--set-formats` and the `--update-metadata` arguments (#141).
- Jupytext can `--pipe` the text representation of a notebook to external programs like `black` or `flake8` (#154, #142)
- The Python representation of notebooks containing PEP8 cells is now expected to be PEP8 compliant (#154).
- Format specification allow prefix and suffix for path and file name (#138, #142). Use `ipynb,prefix/suffix.py:percent` to pair the current notebook named `notebook.ipynb` to a script named `prefixnotebooksuffix.py`. Suffix and prefix can also be configured on the `ipynb` file, with the same syntax.
- Introducing a new `hydrogen` format for scripts, which derives from `percent`. In that format Jupyter magic commands are not commented (#59, #126, #132).
- Introducing a new `bare` format for scripts, which derives from `light`. That format has no cell marker. Use a notebook metadata filter `{"jupytext": {"notebook_metadata_filter":"-all"}}` if you want no YAML header (#152).
- The default format for R script is now `light`, as for the other languages.
- Added support for q/kdb+ notebooks (#161).
- Python scripts or Markdown documents that have no Jupyter metadata receive a metadata filter that ensures that metadata is not exported back to the text representation (#124).
- Metadata filters are represented as strings rather than dictionaries to make YAML headers shorter. Previous syntax from #105 is still supported. They were also renamed to `notebook_metadata_filter` and `cell_metadata_filter`.
- Markdown and RMarkdown formats have a new option `split_at_heading` to split Markdown cells at heading (#130)

**Fixed**

- Main language of scripts is inferred from script extension. Fixes a round trip conversion issue for Python notebooks with a Javascript cell.
- Non-Python scripts opened as notebooks in Jupyter are now correctly saved even when no matching kernel is found.
- Jupyter magic commands like `ls` are commented in the light and R markdown format (#149).
- Cell starting with `%%html`, `%%latex` are now commented out in the `light`, `percent` and `Rmd` formats (#179).

0.8.6 (2018-11-29)
------------------

**Added**

- The `language_info` section is not part of the default header any more. Language information is now taken from metadata `kernelspec.language`. (#105).
- When opening a paired notebook, the active file is now the file that was originally opened (#118). When saving a notebook, timestamps of all the alternative representations are tested to ensure that Jupyter's autosave does not override manual modifications.
- Jupyter magic commands are now commented per default in the `percent` format (#126, #132). Version for the `percent` format increases from '1.1' to '1.2'. Set an option `comment_magics` to `false` either per notebook, or globally on Jupytext's contents manager, or on `jupytext`'s command line, if you prefer not to comment Jupyter magics.
- Jupytext command line has a pre-commit mode (#121).


0.8.5 (2018-11-13)
------------------

**Added**

- `bash` scripts as notebooks (#127)
- R scripts with `.r` extension are supported (#122)
- Jupytext selects the first kernel that matches the language (#120)

0.8.4 (2018-10-29)
------------------

**Added**

- Notebook metadata is filtered - only the most common metadata are stored in the text representation (#105)
- New config option `freeze_metadata` on the content manager and on the command line interface (defaults to `False`). Use this option to avoid creating a YAML header or cell metadata if there was none initially. (#110)
- Language magic arguments are preserved in R Markdown, and also supported in `light` and `percent` scripts (#111, #114, #115)
- First markdown cell exported as a docstring when using the Sphinx format (#107)

0.8.3 (2018-10-19)
------------------

**Added**

- Frozen cells are supported in R Markdown, light and percent scripts (#101)
- Inactive cells extended to percent scripts (#108)
- `jupytext` gains a `--version` argument (#103)
- "ExecuteTime" cell metadata is not included in the text representation anymore (#106)


0.8.2 (2018-10-15)
------------------

**Added**

- Round trip conversion testing with `jupytext --test` was improved (#99)
- Round trip conversion tested on Jake Vanderplas' Python for Data Science Handbook.

**Fixed**

0.8.0 (2018-10-10)
------------------

**Added**

- All `jupytext` related metadata goes to a `jupytext` section (#91). Please make sure your collaborators use the same version of Jupytext, as the new version can read previous metadata, but not the opposite.
- Notebooks extensions can be prefixed with any prefix of at most three chars (#87).
- Export of the same notebook to multiple formats is now supported. To export to all python formats, plus `.ipynb` and `.md`, use `"jupytext": {"formats": "ipynb,pct.py:percent,lgt.py:light,spx.py:sphinx,md"},`.
- README includes a short section on how to extend `light` and `percent` formats to more languages (#61).
- Jupytext's contents manager accepts the `auto` extension in `default_jupytext_formats` (#93).
- All Jupyter magics are escaped in `light` scripts and R markdown documents. Escape magics in other formats with a `comment_magics` metadata (true or false), or with the contents manager `comment_magics` global flag (#94).

**Fixed**

- Trusting notebooks made functional again.
- Command line `jupytext` returns a meaningful error when no argument is given.
- Fixed global pairing configuration (#95).

0.7.2 (2018-10-01)
------------------

**Added**

- `light` and `percent` formats made available for scheme and cpp notebooks. Adding more formats is straightforward - just add a new entry to _SCRIPT_EXTENSIONS in languages.py, a sample notebook and a mirror test (#61)
- Format name is automatically appended to extension in `jupytext_formats` when notebook is loaded/saved.

**Fixed**

- Notebooks extensions can only be prefixed with `.nb` (#87)

- Markdown cells header in sphinx gallery format may have a space between first # and following.

0.7.0 (2018-09-23)
------------------

**Added**

- Header for cells in `percent` format is more robust: use `[markdown]` and `[raw]` to identify cell types. Cell type comes after the cell title. (#59)
- Jupytext can read and write notebooks as Hydrogen/VScode/Spyder/PyCharm compatible scripts (cells starting with `# %%`) (#59)
- Jupytext can read and write notebooks as Sphinx-gallery compatible scripts (#80)
- Metadata are supported for all cell types in light python and percent formats (#66). Due to this, light python format version is now 1.3. Light python notebooks in versions 1.1 and 1.2 are still readable.
- Command line `jupytext` has a `from` argument, and now accepts notebook from the standard input.

**Fixed**

- Fix merging of input and output notebooks (#83)
- Removed extra new line on stdout in command line `jupytext` (#84)

0.6.5 (2018-09-13)

- Package and conversion script renamed from `nbrmd` to `jupytext`.

0.6.0 (2018-08-31)
------------------

**Added**

- Cell parsing and exporting done in two specialized classes. This is way easier to read. Pylint score at 9.9 !
- Python file format updated to 1.1: default end of cell for python scripts is one blank space. Two blank spaces are allowed as well. Now you can reformat code in Python IDE without breaking notebook cells (#38).
- Added support for plain markdown files (#40, #44).
- Demonstration notebooks more user friendly (#45).
- Command line tool simpler to use (#46).
- Start code patterns present in Jupyter cells are escaped.
- Default `nbrmd_format` is empty (mwouts/nbsrc/#5): no Jupyter notebook is created on disk when the user opens a Python or R file and saves it from Jupyter, unless the users asks for it by setting `nbrmd_format`.

**Fixed**

- Fixed message in the `nbsrc` script (#43)
- Technical metadata don't appear any more in scripts unless required (#42)

0.5.0 (2018-08-21)
------------------

**Added**

- Jupyter magic commands escaped when exported (#29)
- 'endofcell' option for explicit (optional) end-of-cell marker (#31)
- 'active' cell option now supported for .py and .R export (#30)
- Raw cells now preserved when exported to .py or .R (#32)
- Extensions can be prefixed, like `.nb.py`, (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- When a file with an extension not associated to 'ipynb' is opened and saved, no 'ipynb' file is created (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- Extensions can now be a sequence of groups. For instance, `nbrmd_formats="ipynb,nb.py;script.ipynb,py"` will create an `ipynb` file when a `nb.py` is opened (and conversely), and a `script.ipynb` file when a `py` file is opened (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- `nbsrc` script was moved to the `nbrmd` package. The `nbsrc` package now only contains the documentation (mwouts/nbsrc#3)
