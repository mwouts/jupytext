# Install the pre-commit hooks below with
# 'pre-commit install'

# Auto-update the version of the hooks with
# 'pre-commit autoupdate'

# Run the hooks on all files with
# 'pre-commit run --all'

# NB: In this config we exclude the example and tests notebooks
# from the code hooks (black, flake8, etc) as we want to keep
# the text representation of the test notebooks unchanged, plus
# the (sync) contentsmanager.py which is generated from the async one.
