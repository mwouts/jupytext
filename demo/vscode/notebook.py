# This paired notebook can be edited either as
# a Python script or as a Jupyter notebook in
# VS Code. Thanks to the Jupytext Sync
# extension, changes are automatically synced to
# the other paired file(s) when you save.
#
# ðŸ’¡ Tip: don't forget to hit "Save" before
# switching to the other editor. If you don't save
# your changes, you will run into conflicting edits
# as VS Code does not autoreload files that have
# unsaved edits.
